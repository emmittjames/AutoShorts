This project is a short-form video generator designed to automate the creation and upload of videos to YouTube. Content is sourced from Reddit using PRAW, screenshots are captured via Selenium, and speech is generated from text using Amazon Polly. The elements are then stitched together and overlaid on a background video. Finally, the videos are automatically uploaded to YouTube using the YouTube Data API.
