This project is a short-form video generator, designed to automate the creation and upload of short-form videos to YouTube. Content is sourced from Reddit using PRAW, screenshots are gathered using Selenium, speech is generated from text using TikTok's TTS API, and everything is stitched together and overlayed on top of a background video. These videos are then automatically uploaded to YouTube via the YouTube Data API.
